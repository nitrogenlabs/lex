# Upgrade Command Testing

The upgrade command is tested using three types of tests:

## CLI Tests

CLI tests verify that the upgrade command correctly interacts with the command line interface:

- Tests that the command correctly upgrades when a newer version is available
- Tests that the command does not upgrade when the current version is the latest
- Tests that the command correctly uses a custom cliPackage when provided
- Verifies error handling

## Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that the upgrade command correctly integrates with other parts of the system:

- Tests that the command correctly parses the configuration before checking versions
- Tests that the command returns the correct exit codes on success and failure
- Tests that the command correctly handles up-to-date and out-of-date scenarios

## Options Tests

Options tests verify that the UpgradeOptions interface works correctly:

- Tests that all options can be set correctly
- Tests that partial options work correctly
- Tests that empty options work correctly
