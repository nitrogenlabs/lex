# Versions Command Testing

The versions command is tested using three types of tests:

## CLI Tests

CLI tests verify that the versions command correctly interacts with the command line interface:

- Tests that the command correctly displays versions in text format by default
- Tests that the command correctly displays versions in JSON format when the json option is true
- Verifies that the command always returns 0 as the exit code

## Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that the versions command correctly integrates with other parts of the system:

- Tests that the parseVersion function correctly removes carets from version strings
- Tests that the jsonVersions function correctly converts package objects to JSON-friendly format
- Tests that the command correctly logs all version information in text format

## Options Tests

Options tests verify that the VersionsCmd interface works correctly:

- Tests that the json option can be set correctly
- Tests that empty options work correctly
