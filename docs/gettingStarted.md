## Installation

Lex is installed globally using npm. Installing via yarn globally does not install correctly.

```shell
// Using npm
$ npm install -g @nlabs/lex
```

## Quick Start

Install Yarn and Lex globally,

```shell
$ npm install -g yarn @nlabs/lex
```

Download a skeleton app with the [ArkhamJS](https://arkhamjs.io) framework and install dependencies

```shell
$ lex init myApp -i
```

Run the development server

```shell
$ lex dev
```
